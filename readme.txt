This folder provides sample data and codes for the feature extraction and matching. Please run 'main.m' to start the program.

Data:
Two subjects, each with two surface normal images, resulted in four surface normal images

Feature Extraction:
Reads from the surface normal images and produces the feature images (4 binary images for each surface normal image)

Matching:
Reads from the feature images and produces the comparison score for each pair of feature images
